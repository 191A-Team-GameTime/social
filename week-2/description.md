#Week 2 Team Social Event

#Gametime

Faraz Ahmad, Damon An, Marissa Gonzales, Ryan Phung, Joshua Jackson

Our team members have schedules that are as diverse and unique as we are.  With that in mind, we agreed to have our social outing be a simple one.  Coffee break together between classes.  This is a temporary thing, as we have all agreed to do a much grander social event when time allows.  Until then, we look forward to our twice weekly coffee breaks together.
